             <p>Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday season organized around it. The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then spread the word.

             <p>Chinese New Year (also called Lunar New Year and celebrated in many countries outside China), starts on the second new moon after the winter solstice. The exact date varies from year to year, but it always falls during the winter. In China, the holiday lasts for weeks!

Celebrations for Chinese New Year take all kinds of forms, from enormous public fireworks displays and exciting lion dances to special family dinners at home and giving children money in red envelopes for good luck. This vibrant, thriving holiday with ancient roots brings warmth and cheer to winter every year!</p>

             <h2>Venice Carnival</h2>
             <p><em>Stephen's Day, December 26) to the end of the carnival season at midnight of Shrove Tuesday</em></p>

             <p>Venice Carnival, Italy Carnival traditions vary widely around the world, from Mardi Gras in New Orleans to the Samba parades in Rio de Janeiro. In Venice, Carnival is all about the masked costume balls. The most in-demand ones like the famous Il Ballo del Doge, the official dinner at Ca 'Vendramin Calergi and the popular Casanova Grand Ball, tend to be prohibitively expensive and sell out quickly, but there are plenty of free events in addition to the balls. As for the backstory, Venice Carnival is tied to a 12th-century Catholic custom that likely evolved from winter solstice practices and marked a period of full-out debauchery before the no-fun season of Lent began. However, it can be argued that plenty of debauchery can still be found today during the two weeks in February leading up to Lent.</p>
